<h3>About bio.maker.lab</h3> 
<p>In Fall 2016, we began exploring how synthetic biology—where living cells are genetically modified to generate new characteristics that can be used in practical ways—can be learned in K-12 learning environments. To accomplish this, we developed the biomakerlab device—a low cost mobile lab device that could be used to genetically modify and fabricate (or grow) bacterial or yeast cells. At the same time, we developed lab and accompanying curriculum activities that not only afforded learners a hands-on opportunity to engage with synthetic biology, but also required that they contemplate socioscientific and ethical issues such as the impact biotechnologies like synthetic biology have on society, the environment and ecosystems.  

All curriculum units involve a fabrication phase where students use the biomakerlab device to fabricate genetically modified cell lines. Each unit then has a unique a research & development phase where students make unique practical uses of newly fabricated cells and present their outcomes using a variety of mediums. The three curricular units we developed include bioLOGO, bioSENSOR and bioCAKES. Below is a summary of the fabrication phase and key outcomes in each curricular unit during the research and development phase.

<h3>Fabrication Phase</h3> 

<p>Step 1: Students genetically modify microbial cell lines suing temperature based transformation protocol and load cells into 15ml synringes.</p>

<p>Step 2: Students load syringes into biomakerlab device where fabrication (or cell growth) will occur.</p>

<p>Step 3: The biomakerlab device has a spectrophotometer which can be used to measure cellular growth and a rotating platform which serves as a agitator that supports gas exchange and cell respiration. Both cell growth measures and rate of agitation can be monitored and controlled remotely using a web-based interface controller (https://biomakerlab.github.io/). </p>

<p>Step 4: The biomakerlab device is also equipped with a heat fan that can be controlled remotely and support optimal cellular growth for a variety of microbial cell lines.</p>

<h3>Research & Development Phase</h3> 
The research and development phase involves three common steps including: 

<ol>
  <li>A design step where students design an application for fabricated microbes</li>
  <li>An implementation step where students use newly fabricated microbial products or microbes </li>
  <li>an outcome step where students produce actual or novel imagined applications for their fabricated products.</li>
</ol> 
</p>

<p> <h3> The broader learning community (this comes from the 2018 annual report): </h3>

On February 17, 2018, we held a private workshop with experts from community science labs, exhibit and tool design, and K-12 science education and a public symposium  at the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, PA. The goal was to build collaborations that could advance our individual efforts in device development, curriculum design, community outreach. In the workshop, we discussed critical issues for bringing biodesign into K-12 education. Also attending were several doctoral students and a postdoctoral fellow from the Graduate School of Education who had helped organize the event.

The public learn.design.bio event took place in the afternoon (the website provides more information about the speakers: https://learn.design.bio). Over 48 people from the larger Philadelphia area registered for the event and about 43 actually came to the event. Event registrants came from a variety of sectors including: universities (62%), high schools (28%) and private organizations (10%). The post-secondary institutions represented included various schools within the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, Thomas Jefferson University and Northwestern University. The secondary institutions represented came largely from the School District of Philadelphia and one from the Herndon School District. Private organizations included the Science Center, DNA Simple and HGE Health. Individuals in these institutions ranged from university faculty and students, high school teachers and administrators, to artists and researchers. 

We had four panels plus a small exhibit: 

<ol>
  <li>The first panel focused on educational initiatives that had brought biodesign into education. Speakers included Lindsey D’Ecuyer, an ambassador from the Biobuilder Foundation (Boston, MA), who presented the Biobuilder program. Romie Littrell from the Pratt Institute (New York, NY) reported on several installations that were designed for the Tech Museum in San Jose, CA, which hosts the first exhibit open to the public. Finally, Karen Hogan from Penn Biology (Philadelphia, PA) talked about initiatives to bring undergraduates into biodesign.</li>
  <li>The second panel presented various tool kits and labs that have been designed to support biodesign activities. Julie Legault and Justin Perrara from Amino (Toronto, Canada) presented Amino Labs and new developments. Orkan Telhan from Penn Design (Philadelphia, PA) showcased Biomakerlab while Amanda Strohacker from Wellesley (Boston, MA) stood in for Orit Shaer and presented Crispee.  </li>
  <li>The third panel included three teachers who had brought biodesign activities into their science classrooms: Justice Walker from Penn GSE (Philadelphia, PA), Sheri Hanna from String Theory School (Philadelphia, PA) and Lindsey D’Ecuyer (Andover High School). They shared their experiences with students and activities. </li>
  <li>The fourth and final panel focused on ethical issues and was moderated by Orkan Telhan, School of Design. Panelists were Sigal Ben-Porath from Penn GSE (Philadelphia, PA), Dan Grushkin from Genspace (New York, NY) and Ryan Hoover from MICA (Baltimore, MD). The meeting concluded with an exhibit in which many panelist brought examples of labs and materials for the audience. </li>
